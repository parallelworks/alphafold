# alphafold
Alphafold template workflow

# Setup

To pull this code directly from Github onto
the Parallel Works platform,
1. create a new workflow on the platform,
2. navigate into the new workflow's directory in `/pw/workflows/`,
3. delete any default/sample files that were created,
4. Run the following command in that directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parallelworks/alphafold .
```
(Don't forget the . at the end of the command!)

# Run

Navigate to the compute tab and select the workflow
from the column on the left side.  The options on
the resulting form are controlled by `workflow.xml`
in the workflow folder.
